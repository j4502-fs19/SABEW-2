  <p> JT Cavalenes was recently denied for his first credit card. He’s a freshman at Kennesaw State University and decided to apply for a credit card after his parents advised him to start planning for his future.</p>

<p> Friends of Alexis Manson call her the “budget queen” because of her categorized budget spreadsheets and careful spending habits. “For me, building credit and good practices during college feels lower risk than waiting until after college,” Manson said. “I think it’s better to start learning right now while I have a bit of a safety net than wait and be overwhelmed by new expenses at the same time that I’m beginning to build credit.”</p>

<p> When Meriah Grove was a freshman at the University of Georgia in 2016, she walked into the office of the UGA Entrepreneurship Program and asked how she could get involved. “My passion and my life is creating something out of nothing,” said Grove, a senior advertising major from Roswell, Georgia.</p>

  <br>by Mimi Wright </h4>
  <p> If there is one piece of advice that I would give to any college student, it would be this: study abroad. The experiences, connections and sights you see are priceless. But unfortunately, the trip is not. Studying abroad is a hefty financial undertaking. It can be extremely overwhelming when you are faced with the program fee, because I know I was. A helpful tip: PLAN AHEAD.</p>

<br>by Chloe Thornberry </h4>
<p> Arriving in the country that’s you’ve chosen to do your study abroad is a thrill. But it’s just the start – now that you’ve taken this big leap, you might as well see as much of the world as possible. If there are alarms going off in your head telling you that sounds off-the-wall expensive, take a breath. There are ways to travel abroad without breaking the bank.</p>

<p> Who would have thought that a journalism major would be working in a university financial aid office, but I’m glad I do!  In today’s world of student loans and repayment plans, life can get the best of your wallet. After all, two-thirds of students at public universities like mine have student loans.</p>
