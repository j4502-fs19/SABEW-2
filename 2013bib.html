<p><b>Winner: </b>Cam Simpson, <b>Bloomberg Businessweek, </b>for &#8220;Stranded.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>When Apple launched its iPhone 5 in fall of 2012, the heat was on suppliers to get the devices on the shelves. According to Bloomberg Businessweek reporter Cam Simpson, the company "had planned… the most aggressive production-and-launch schedule ever attempted by Apple." But in that rush to satisfy Apple customers, Simpson found in reporting this investigative piece, there were some who paid a very steep price: the 1,500 workers from Nepal who paid job brokers to be flown to Malaysia to assemble cameras for the new smartphones. When the work was moved to a different factory, the workers became stranded in a legal limbo for two months, unpaid, unable to go home and frightened of starving to death. With his vivid, harrowing report, Simpson exposed a darker side of the electronics supply chain. His work forced Apple &#8212; and the U.S. government – to take notice and work to stop the brokers who demand payments from factory job recruits. After reading this tale of exploitation, you'll never look at your iPhone the same way.</i></p>

But, most important, it displays the hallmark of a good investigative piece &#8212; impact. Diligent, deep reporting led Bloomberg Markets to uncover an illegal activity that thrives &#8220;because no one outside the nation has bothered to notice&#8221; it. Following this six-month investigation, now some companies have stopped buying tungsten from Columbia. In addition, the European Union changed its laws to prevent companies from buying minerals that fund conflict in Columbia.</i><b><i> </i></b></p>
